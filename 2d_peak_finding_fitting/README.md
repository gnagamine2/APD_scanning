# 2D peak finding and fitting

#### authors: Julian Santen (for BSc) and Dr. Gabriel Nagamine Gomez

**Purpose:** Script to read ASC files generated by EMCCD Andor software. It find gaussian peaks from an image and fits 
them. It analyzes all the ASC files in a folder.

**Assumptions**
* The Andor spectra only contains the spectrum of a single dot in the vertical direction

**Scripts**
* `Fitting_SingleDots_lmfit.py`
  * Script that analyzes the obtained spectra and creates plots for individual measurement days
  * For each provided folder it will create plots and csvs. However, if a comparison between multiple days is wanted\
  use the `Custom_Plots.py` script 
* `Custom_Plots.py`
  * Script that allows the user to compare measurements of multiple days and create boxplots and normal spectra plots
  * The files need to be previously analyzed with the `Fitting_SingleDots_lmfit.py` script
  * **Attention**: Special care needs to be taken when setting the `upper_limit_fwhm` as this is a pre-selection
    on the FWHM! All particles with a FWHM above `upper_limit_fwhm` are discarded
